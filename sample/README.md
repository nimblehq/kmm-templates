### Set up a new project

Follow these steps to set up a new project from the template:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Fetch all git sub-modules for the first time:

    `$ git submodule update --init --recursive`

3. Generate the new project by running the following command:

    `$ ./make.sh --bundle-id co.nimblehq.kmm.template --bundle-id-staging co.nimblehq.kmm.template.staging --project-name sample --ios-version 14.0`

    To skip CI/CD service generating from iOS script, export this CI env:
